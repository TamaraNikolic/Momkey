        <item>The best affirmations are those that are spoken with your own voice. The own voice is the subconscious trusts and is therefore not blocked.</item>
        <item>In conventional subliminal apps the user does not know, which affirmations are transmitted. With the Monkey app, you can give yourself a targeted program. Your specific needs and desires, you can now program into your subconscious</item>
        <item>Go to Main page Record and click on the red record button below. Now you can start to speak your affirmations into your phone with a second break in between.
